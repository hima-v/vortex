          <u>Theory</u>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves assigning a grammatical
          category or part-of-speech label to each word in a sentence. The part-of-speech of a word defines its syntactic or
          grammatical role within the sentence. Common POS categories include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns,
          prepositions, conjunctions, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main objective of POS tagging is to analyze the structure and meaning of a sentence by categorizing
          each word correctly. By determining the part-of-speech of each word, NLP systems can better understand the relationships
          between words and phrases, which is essential for various language processing tasks like information extraction, syntactic
          parsing, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          POS tagging is usually approached as a supervised machine learning problem, where a model is trained on a
          labeled dataset of sentences where each word is annotated with its corresponding part-of-speech label.
          The model learns the patterns and context in which different words occur and can then generalize to tag unseen sentences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditional POS tagging methods involved rule-based approaches and the use of lexicons or dictionaries.
          However, more advanced techniques, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs),
          and neural network-based models like Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (BiLSTM) or Transformer models,
          have shown superior performance in modern NLP tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          POS tagging is a crucial preprocessing step in many NLP applications, as it provides essential linguistic information
          that enables subsequent analysis and understanding of text data.

          <u>Case Study Domains</u>
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Social Media Sentiment Analysis:
          </li>
          <p>
            In this domain, we aim to analyze the sentiment of social media posts (e.g., tweets, Facebook statuses) to understand
            public opinion about a particular topic or brand. POS tagging can be used to preprocess the text and extract important
            features for sentiment classification. This case study would focus on how POS tagging improves sentiment analysis accuracy
            and helps identify sentiment-bearing words more effectively.

            Medical Text Analysis:
          </li>
          <p>
            In the medical domain, electronic health records (EHRs), research articles, and clinical notes contain valuable
            information. POS tagging can assist in extracting medical entities like diseases, symptoms, medications, and procedures.
            This case study would explore how POS tagging aids in the information extraction process and contributes to medical data
            analysis and knowledge discovery.

            Machine Translation:
          </li>
          <p>
            POS tagging is crucial for machine translation systems to understand the role of words in the source language
            sentence and generate appropriate translations in the target language.
